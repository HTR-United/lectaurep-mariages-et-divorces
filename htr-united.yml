transcription-guidelines: >
    The transcription respects what is written (abbreviations are not developed, capitalization follows 19th century practices). Superscripted portions of text are signaled by "^" and many signatures are transcription with ¥.
    The lines containing printed text are associated with the type "printed" and the signatures are associated with the type "signature". Thus they can both be removed from the dataset if necessary. '
