transcription-guidelines: "The transcription respects what is written (abbreviations\
  \ are not developed, capitalization follows 19th century practices). Superscripted\
  \ portions of text are signaled by `^` and many signatures are transcription with\
  \ \xA5. The lines containing printed text are associated with the type `printed`\
  \ and the signatures are associated with the type `signature`. Thus they can both\
  \ be removed from the dataset if necessary.'\n"
