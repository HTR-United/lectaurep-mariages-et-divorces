transcription-guidelines: >
    The transcription respects what is written (abbreviations are not developed, capitalization follows 19th century practices). Superscripted portions of text are signaled by `^` and many signatures are transcription with ¥.
    The lines containing printed text are associated with the type `printed` and the signatures are associated with the type `signature`. Thus they can both be removed from the dataset if necessary.'
